                <h3> Functions, Variables and Parameters </h3>

                <section>
                    A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure, it is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. 
                    Where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output it should be able to take some input and return 
                    an output. This clearly makes a procedure to qualify as a function. We have many different types of functions. 
                    Here in this lesson we will see how functions is used to showcase understanding of loops, Conditional Statements, and Arrays. 
                    For a better understanding of functions we need to explain variables and parameters. All programs uses variables and 
                    parameters that contains values that the program will need.<br>
                        <blockquote><b>Variable</b> - In programming a variable is basically a box that contains something. It could be a number, text, or something else. We can define a variable using this format.
                        <blockquote>var varnameN = "valueN";</blockquote>
                            The keyword var enables the computer to know we are creating a new box. The = means that we are putting something in
                             the box. To make it easier when we define variables with functions, strings, or even lists, you have to think about variables like this syntax above.
                             <br></blockquote>
                    <blockquote><b>Parameters</b> - I will like to define parameter in simple terms. In this context lets say a parameter is used 
                        to identify which variables will be used in the function. Again to make more sense we could say a parameter is a named variable passed into a function
                         Think about parameter as variables used to import arguments into functions. we could call the variables doors into a function.
                         The doors are labeled. Once information goes through the door it can be used in the function. 
                         It also lets the program pass information into the function. </blockquote>
                        <br>All functions follow the same format and have the same basic parts.<br>
                    <blockquote>function funcnameN(<i>parameter1, parameter2,...</i>){
                            <blockquote>
                        statements; <br>
                        return value; <br>
                                }</blockquote>
                    </blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li> function keyword - this lets the computer know you are starting a function</li>
                        <li> funcnameN - this unique identifier is used to call (or run) the function. </li>
                        <li> parameter list - this is used to identify what variables (information) will be fed into the function. when the function is called using its name, the value of the parameters can be assigned.</li>
                        <li> statements - this is where all the work of the function is done. </li>
                        <li> return value - this is the result of the function or what comes out of it. It is returned to the part of the program that called the function (or made it run)</li>
                    </ul>
                   Now lets show some functions at work!

                    <!--- Loops --->
                    <h3><a name="loops"></a> Loops </h3>
                    <section>
                        Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly, refer to a function where the statments are run multiple times while a certian 
                        condition is followed. For our example we are going to do a loop that will display a times table. The user will input the 
                        times table they want to see and how large they want it to be. When the user clicks the button, the computer will call the 
                        function to run. The statements inside the function thus calculate the times table, add each times table to what will be the 
                        output, until the users specificity is met in relation to the table size. As soon as the table size is met, the program will 
                        send the total times table to the computer for display. For clarity lets see what the code for this loop looks like below.

                        <blockquote>

                            function timesTable(timesTableNum, tableSize){ <br>
                           <blockquote> var timesTableNum = parseInt(document.getElementById("timesTableNumInput").value); <br>
                            var tableSize = parseInt(document.getElementById("timesTableSizeInput").value); <br>
                            var ans = 0; <br>
                            var i = 0; <br>
                            var output = "";<br>
                                while (i<=tableSize)
                                     {<br><blockquote>
                                     ans = timesTableNum*i;
                                     output += timesTableNum + " x " + i + "    = " + ans + &lt;br&gt;;<br>
                                     i++;}</blockquote>
                        document.getElementById("timesTableDiv").innerHTML = output; }</blockquote>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h4> Loops Example - Times Tables</h4>
            Please enter which times table you want to see <br>   <i>(example "4" for a 4 times table or "11" for 11 times table)</i> 
            <input type="text" id="timesTableNumInput"> <br>
            Please enter the size of table you would like to see. This will be the last times table you will see. <br>    <i>(example for a table that goes from 4x0 -> 4x11 enter "11")</i> 
            <input type="text" id="timesTableSizeInput">
            <button type="button" onclick="timesTable()"> Show the table!</button><br>
                Results: <br>
            <div id="timesTableDiv"></div>

            <!---- Logical Statements ---->
            <h3><a name="condState"></a> Logical Statements </h3>
            <section>
                in this section we are looking at logical conditions that allow you to control the flow of a program, it thus gives a logical condition 
                telling the computer to evaluate if a condition is true. This is a natural occurrence that will observe in our everyday life.
                For example, in order to join a boys scout by yourself you have to be at least 12 years old and 80 inches tall. We can write a function 
                to ask the user for their age and height to determine if they can join boys scout. If the applicant is over 80 inches tall but not 
                yet 12years old they can still join with the consent of their parents. The function would look like this.
                <blockquote>
                    function canRide(age,height){
                   <blockquote> var age = parseInt(document.getElementById("riderAge").value);<br>
                    var height = parseInt(document.getElementById("riderHeight").value);<br>
                    var output = "";<br>
                    <blockquote>if (age >= 12 && height >= 80){<br>
                    <blockquote>output = "Hooray! You can join boys scout by yourself!";<br>
                        }</blockquote>
                    else if (height >= 80){<br>
                    <blockquote>output = "Not quite old enough, but don't give up! You can still join with the consent of your parents!";<br>
                        }</blockquote>
                    else {<br>
                    <blockquote>output = "I am sorry you must be over 80 inches to join, and 12 or older to join by yourself";<br>
                        }</blockquote></blockquote>
                    document.getElementById("joinDiv").innerHTML = output;
                       }</blockquote>

                 </blockquote>

                 Lets give it a try!
                 <h4> Logical condition Example</h4>
                 The Boy Scouts of America is the largest scouting organization and one of the largest youth organizations in the United States
                 with about 2.3 million youth participants and about one million adult volunteers
                 Even if no one else wants to join, because of it varst nature it is a must join. Lets find out if you can join by yourself. <br>
                 How old are you? <input type="text" id="applicantAge"><br>
                 How tall are you in inches? <input type="text" id="applicantHeight"><br>
                 Can you join? <button type="button" onclick="canJoin()"> Find out!</button><br>
                 Results: <div id="joinDiv"></div>

                         <!---- Arrays --->
                         <section>
                            <h3><a name="array"></a>Arrays</h3>
                            Arrays are a neat way of storing a list of data items under a single variable name and it is a special  
                            kind of variable that can hold more than one value. It allows us to store lists in one variable. 
                             Here are a few important things to understand about arrays. <br>
            
                             Syntax - var<italics>array_name = [item1, item2, item3,...]</italics><br>
                            Creating an Array - To create a new array we use "new" keyword like in the following example:
                                <blockquote> var join = <italics>new</italics> Array[ Boys Brigade, Church Lads Brigade, YMCA Boy Scouts]</blockquote>
                            Each item seperated by a comma is stored in a spot in the array. Each spot is numbered starting with 0. You can see any item in an array by using its number.
                                <blockquote>For example: join[0] = boys Brigade, join[1]= Church Lads Brigade </blockquote>
                            You can add new items to an existing array by "pushing" into the list.
                                <blockquote>For example: join.push( Chums Scout Patrols) would add " Chums Scout Patrols" to the last spot in our array.</blockquote>
                            Array Length - All arrays have a special property called "length" this tells us how many items are in the array.
                                <blockquote>For example: var join = [Boys Brigade, Church Lads Brigade, YMCA Boy Scouts, Chums Scout Patrols]; join.length = 4</blockquote>
            <br>Lets do some fun examples using the array we have already created.<br>
            Add another scout organization to the array<input type="text" id="newApplicant">
            <button type="button" onclick="addApplicant()">Add Applicant</button>
            <br>Here is the new list of applicant we plan to allow join the boys scout organization:
            <div id="joinArrayDiv"></div>
            We just found out that the boys scout are off to a new season. Too bad! Lets change it to "Join new scout season" since they can join in the coming new season too.
            <button type="button" onclick="addNew()">Switch Join</button><br>
            Here is our updated list of applicants:
            <div id="updatedJoinDiv"></div>
                       </section>
