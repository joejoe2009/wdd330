            <!---The importance of testing and debugging--->
            <h3 id="testing"> Testing </h3>

            <p>Errors is an unavoidable phenomenon in programming. As programmers we try our 
                best to minimize it impacts and ensure that we find ways to identify and deal 
                with them quickly. In this section we will be discussing the importance of 
                testing. <br>
<h4>The Importance of Testing</h4><hr>
The importance of testing is glaring before programmers as this will help to identify any 
defects or errors that could possibly be made during development phase. In making sure this is
 achieved programmers ensure exceptions are caught and dealth with, and code is tested 
 rigorously. Product success is gauged by customers reliability on the product. Its quality 
 speaks volume, So for us to deliver high quality product, proper testing is required, as this 
 enhances the level of support or facilities given to the customers. Moreover, a well-tested 
 product incurs lesser maintenance cost and so the results delivered are more accurate, 
 consistent and reliable.With the help of testing the overall security of the product can be 
 improved. For this reasons programmer should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in 
 development so any errors can be identified and fixed quickly. For us to eliminate silent 
 javaScript error we would talk briefly about Strict Mode and its benefit <br>

 <h4>Strict Mode and Its Benefit</h4><hr>
 Strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors. it prevent
 errors, when relatively “unsafe” actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object)
 The aim to “use strict” literal is to indicate that the code should be executed in the 
 “strict mode.” It helps us to identify some hidden bugs. We can’t use undeclared variables in
  strict mode. below we list some benefits of Strict Mode: <br>
 <strong>Benefits</strong>
  <li>Strict mode makes it easier to write “secure” JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Strict mode prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.</li>
  <li>strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that’s not strict mode.</li>
  <li>Strict mode fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations:</li><br>
  Generally, strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written that befits 
  a programmer, so its use is recommended. Using strict mode in javascript the following image 
  shows the string to be added in the first line of a JavaScript file.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="image/sm.png" alt="string to be added in javascript file"> <br>
  <br>
  It is important we know of "Strict Mode Invocation" as strict mode is applicable to entire 
  scripts or the individual functions. We can’t apply it to the block statements enclosed in {} 
  braces. If we try to use it inside blocks, it will have NO effect. The image below shows applying 'Strict' mode to the entire Script. <br>
  <br>
  <img src="image/sm1.png" ait="applying strict"><br>
  <br>

  use strict statement has eliminated some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw 
  errors. It is quite useful when we are debugging any web Application. This images below will
  show us the effect of using'Strict' and not using 'Strict' in a Javascript file.<br>
  <br>
  <li>using ‘strict’ statement</li>
  <img src="image/smm.png" alt="using strict"><br>
  <br>
  <li>without ‘strict’</li>
  <img src="image/smm1.png" alt="withou strict"><br>
  <br>
  You can even use strict mode on a per-function basis by adding the line inside a function. 
  Strict mode will then only be applied to anything inside that function: the image below will 
  help to illustrate the use of strict inside a function.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="image/sm2.png" alt="using strict inside a function"><br>
  <br>
  what the above image shows us is that scope of “use strict” is bound to function only and 
  not the whole script file.<br>
  <br>
  <h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3><hr>
  Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with 
  them. It is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also 
  called as ‘bugs’) in a code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash. Lets look at some debugging tools<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Debugging Tools</strong><br>
  <br>
  Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints in your 
  code that will pause it at certain points. Then all values of the variables can be seen at 
  these points and then get modified. Thus this can be very handy when trying to track down bugs.
  Below is the links to the debugger documentation for each of the major browsers:<br>
  <br>
  <li>Chrome</li>
  <li>Edge</li>
  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>Safari</li>
  <br>
  One useful commands is the debuuger Keyword. This will create a breakpoint in a code that 
  will pause the execution of the code and allow one to see where the program is currently up to.
  You can hover over any variables to see what value they hold at that point
  The image example below shows how the debugger command can be used, as you then invoke the 
  amIOldEnough() function, the browser's debugging tool will automatically 
  kick in and you'll be able see the value of the age variable by hovering over it:<br>
  <br>
  <img src="image/sm3.png" alt="debugger command"><br>
  <br>
  It is important to remember to remove any references to the debugger command before shipping any code, otherwise 
  the program will appear to freeze when people try to use it!
